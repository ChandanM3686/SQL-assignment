    "What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "ans. A database is a structured collection of data that can be stored, managed, and accessed electronically. It is used to store data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve, update, and manipulate as needed. Databases are used in a wide range of applications, including business, finance, healthcare, education, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL. Here's how they differ:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational model. They are organized into tables with columns and rows, with each row representing a single record in the table. SQL databases use a standardized language, SQL, to query, manipulate, and retrieve data. Some popular SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, do not follow a rigid schema like SQL databases. They are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, such as text, images, videos, and JSON documents. NoSQL databases can be classified into several categories, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family databases. Some popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis."

    "A primary key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. A primary key is used to enforce data integrity, ensure that each row in the table is unique, and provide a way to link related tables together. The values in a primary key column must be unique, and the column or columns that make up the primary key cannot contain null values.\n",
